                        <p>For my 15th
                            birthday, I got a job at Enzo’s No Frills. I was excited to meet new people and gain new
                            life
                            skills. During the 5 years (and counting) since then, I’ve met many people and acquired many
                            skills
                            that will help me throughout my personal and professional life.</p>

                        <p>Though it was short, my time at the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services
                            taught me key skills used in the business and software engineering world. The MGCS has set
                            an
                            incredible foundation for my future life.</p>
